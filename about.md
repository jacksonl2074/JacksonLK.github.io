# About Me 

Hello, my name is <em><b>Laura</b></em>! I have created this webpage for a final project in my CTI 110 (Web, Programming, and Databases) class at Fayetteville Technical Community College (FTCC). I am currently studying Computer Programming & Development, as well as Geospatial Intelligence Studies.

I am from Raleigh, North Carolina, USA, and am a graduate of NC State University. Go Wolfpack!

I have a pet Dachshund, "wiener dog", named Evelyn, and she is 11.5 years old! She is literally my child - that's how much I love her!
