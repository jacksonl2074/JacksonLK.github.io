# About Me 

Hello, my name is <em><b>Laura</b></em>! I have created this webpage for a final project in my CTI 110 (Web, Programming, and Databases) class at Fayetteville Technical Community College (FTCC). I am currently studying Computer Programming & Development, as well as Geospatial Intelligence Studies.

I am from Raleigh, North Carolina, USA, and am a graduate of NC State University. Go Wolfpack!

I have a pet Dachshund, "wiener dog", named Evelyn, and she is 11.5 years old! She is literally my child - that's how much I love her!

I had a pet Dachshund named Walter, but he passed away 2 years ago. He lived for 13.5 years & was a black-and-tan dog just like Evelyn. Walter had two major spinal injuries that caused him to lose most use of his hind legs. I bought him a little cart, AKA a doggie wheelchair, and he absolutely loved it! He lived his life as though he had no disability.
